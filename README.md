ChowdhuryX Organization - Official Website 🚀

A high-performance, responsive corporate website developed for ChowdhuryX Organization LLC, a US-based IT Consulting and Recruitment firm.

This project demonstrates modern UI/UX principles, featuring a "Deep Space" dark mode aesthetic, glassmorphism effects, and seamless single-page navigation without page reloads.

🔗 Live Demo: https://chowdhuryx.com/

🎨 Design Philosophy

The design focuses on a "Future of IT" aesthetic, utilizing:

Deep Space Backgrounds: Using Tailwind's slate-950 and ambient background blobs.

Glassmorphism: Translucent cards and navigation bars with backdrop filters (backdrop-blur-md).

Brand Colors: Emerald Green (#10b981) and Teal accents.

Smooth Animations: Custom floating, glowing, and pulsing effects defined in the Tailwind config.

✨ Key Features

1. Single Page Application (SPA) Feel

Built with Vanilla JavaScript routing (route() function).

Sections (Home, About, Services, FAQ, Contact) transition smoothly without refreshing the browser.

Active states are updated dynamically in the navigation bar.

2. Interactive Service & Product Modals

Clicking on service cards (e.g., BPO, Web Dev) or Product cards (SmartWrite AI) opens detailed modals.

Modals feature custom enter/exit animations (scaling and opacity transitions).

Backdrop clicking closes the modal for better UX.

3. Advanced Tailwind Configuration

Custom Animations: animate-float, animate-glow, and animate-blob configured directly in the script.

Responsive Typography: Uses 'Outfit' (Sans) and 'Space Grotesk' (Display) fonts.

4. Developer Easter Egg 👨‍💻

Includes a hidden Developer Panel showing version info and stack details.

Try it: Press Ctrl + Shift + D on the keyboard to toggle the panel.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Core: HTML5, Semantic Web Markup

Styling: Tailwind CSS (via CDN for rapid prototyping)

Scripting: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

Icons: Lucide Icons & FontAwesome

Fonts: Google Fonts (Outfit & Space Grotesk)
